# Meme soundboard

This is the official release of the highly-requested-by-literally-no-one [Meme soundboard web app!](https://the-meme-soundboard.web.app/)
It doesn't have many features at the moment, but the ones it does have are:

- ▶️ Playing, pausing & restarting quickly with pre-buffering

- 📄 Beautiful [List of changes](https://github.com/Jabster28/meme-soundboard/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), thanks to [Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) and the use of [Conventional Commit Messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#specification)

- ⚡  Fast, thanks to CoffeeScript & compiled Vue files under the hood, and:

- 🌃 Perpetual dark mode (I forgot to add a toggle :/)

So yeah, use this if you need to drop a crab rave in the middle of a call or something.
